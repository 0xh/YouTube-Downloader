/**
 * Describes a logger instance
 *
 * @deprecated since version 0.8, to be removed in 0.9. Use `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` instead
 *
 * This interface is compatible with PSR-3 Psr\Log\LoggerInterface
 *
 * The message MUST be a string or object implementing __toString().
 *
 * The message MAY contain placeholders in the form: {foo} where foo
 * will be replaced by the context data in key "foo".
 *
 * The context array can contain arbitrary data, the only assumption that
 * can be made by implementors is that if an Exception instance is given
 * to produce a stack trace, it MUST be in a key named "exception".
 *
 * See https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-3-logger-interface.md
 * for the full interface specification.
